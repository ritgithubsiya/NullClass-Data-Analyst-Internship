Task 2 – Company Size vs Company Name (Scatter Plot):

Created a scatter plot showing Company Size (horizontal axis) vs Company Name (vertical axis / labels), with each dot representing one job posting.
Only very specific Mechanical Engineer jobs are shown after applying multiple strict filters.

Filters / Conditions Applied:

Job Title must be exactly “Mechanical Engineer”
→ Dragged Job Title field to Filters shelf
→ Selected only “Mechanical Engineer” from the list
→ This keeps only exact matches (no similar titles like “Senior Mechanical Engineer”).

Work Type = Full-Time or Part-Time
→ Dragged Work Type field to Filters shelf
→ Checked both “Full-Time” and “Part-Time”
→ Excluded all other types (Intern, Contract, etc.)

Preference = Male
→ Dragged Preference field to Filters shelf
→ Selected only “Male”

Job Portal = Idealist
→ Dragged Job Portal field to Filters shelf
→ Selected only “Idealist”

Country must be in Asia but not starting with “I”
→ Created calculated field named asia country (or similar):
→ Formula:textIF [Country] IN (
    "China", "Japan", "South Korea", "Pakistan",
    "Bangladesh", "Sri Lanka", "Nepal", "Bhutan",
    "Myanmar", "Thailand", "Vietnam", "Malaysia",
    "Singapore", "Philippines", "Cambodia",
    "Laos", "Mongolia", "Saudi Arabia", "UAE",
    "Qatar", "Kuwait", "Bahrain", "Oman",
    "Yemen", "Jordan", "Lebanon", "Syria",
    "Turkey", "Afghanistan", "Maldives", "Brunei",
    "Macao SAR", "Syrian Arab Republic", "North Korea",
    "Azerbaijan", "Armenia", "Kyrgyz Republic", "Russia"
    // added any Asian countries present in my data
)
AND LEFT([Country],1) <> "I"
THEN TRUE
ELSE FALSE
END→ Dragged this calculated field to Filters shelf → Selected True
→ This keeps only Asian countries (listed explicitly) and excludes any starting with “I” (like India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, etc.).

Experience must be > 5 years
→ Dragged Experience field to Filters shelf
→ Selected “Range of Values”
→ Set minimum > 5 (or created calculated field: INT([Experience]) > 5 → True)

Salary must be above $50,000
→ Created calculated field named minimum salary extracted (same logic as Task 1)
→ Dragged Company Size field to Filters shelf
→ Selected “Range of Values”
→ Set maximum = 49,999

Company Name must have at least 2 vowels
→ Created calculated field named twoVowelComp (or “at least 2 vowels”):
→ Formula:textLEN(REGEXP_REPLACE(LOWER([Company]), '[^aeiou]', '')) >= 2→ Dragged this field to Filters shelf → Selected True
→ This ensures company names have at least 2 vowels (a, e, i, o, u – case insensitive), like “General Dynamics” or “Deutsche Post”.

Chart must only be displayed between 3 PM and 5 PM IST
→ Created calculated field named show chart time(same logic as Task 1)
→ This hides the chart outside 3:00 PM – 4:59 PM IST (based on system time).

Chart Setup Summary:

Columns: Company Size (continuous measure)
Rows: Company (dimension – shows company names vertically)
Mark type: Circle (Automatic worked well)
Detail / Label: Company (so names appear next to dots)
Size: Slightly adjusted for better visibility
Title: “Task2-Scatter Plot”

Result Note:
Only a few companies remained after all strict filters:
Deutsche Post DHL Group, General Dynamics, Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings, UGI, Xiaomi Corporation.
Each dot shows one posting with company size on x-axis and name on y-axis/labels.
This scatter plot clearly highlights larger companies (up to ~46K employees) that posted Mechanical Engineer jobs matching all conditions.
