Task 1 – Preference vs Work Type (Intern Bar Chart) – Filter Implementation in Tableau
Objective:
Created a bar chart showing the number of Intern job postings by Preference (Both, Female, Male) after applying multiple strict conditions. The bars are sorted in descending order by count.
Filters / Conditions Applied:

Work Type must be “Intern”
→ Dragged the Work Type field to the Filters shelf
→ Selected only “Intern” from the list
→ This ensures the chart shows data only for internship positions.

Latitude must be below 10
→ Dragged Latitude field to Filters shelf
→ Chose “Range of Values”
→ Set maximum value to 9.99 (or < 10)
→ This keeps only job postings located near or below the equator.

Country name must not start with A, B, C, or D
→ Dragged Country field to Filters shelf
→ Went to the General tab
→ Manually selected all countries that do not start with A, B, C, or D (unselected A*, B*, C*, D* starting ones)
→ This removes countries like Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, etc. from the beginning letters.

Job Title must be a single word with fewer than 10 characters
→ Created calculated field named “job title filter”
→ Formula:textLEN(TRIM([Job Title])) < 10 
AND 
CONTAINS([Job Title], ' ') = FALSE→ Dragged this field to Filters shelf → Selected True
→ This keeps only short, single-word job titles (example: “Nurse”, “Paralegal”, “Driver”)

Company Size must be below 50,000
→ Dragged Company Size field to Filters shelf
→ Selected “Range of Values”
→ Set maximum = 49,999
→ This includes only jobs from small and medium companies (less than 50,000 employees)

Salary must be above $9,000
→ Step 1: Created calculated field named minimum salary extracted
→ Formula (extracts the lower end of salary range and handles "K" notation):textFLOAT(
    REGEXP_REPLACE(
        REGEXP_EXTRACT([Salary Range], '(\d{1,3}(,\d{3})*(\.\d+)?)'),
        ',', ''
    )
)
*
IF CONTAINS(LOWER([Salary Range]), 'k') THEN 1000 ELSE 1 END→ Step 2: Created another calculated field named salary > 9000
→ Formula:text[minimum salary extracted] > 9000→ Dragged salary > 9000 to Filters shelf → Selected True
→ This keeps only postings where the starting salary is more than $9,000.

Experience must be an even number
→ Created calculated field named “even experience”
→ Formula:textINT([Experience]) % 2 = 0→ Dragged to Filters shelf → Selected True
→ This keeps only rows where years of experience are even (2, 4, 6, 8…)

Job Posting Date must be in an odd-numbered month
→ Created calculated field named “odd month”
→ Formula:textMONTH([Job Posting Date]) % 2 = 1→ Dragged to Filters shelf → Selected True
→ This includes only postings done in January, March, May, July, September, November.

Chart must only be displayed between 3 PM and 5 PM IST
→ Created calculated field named “show chart time” (or similar)
→ Formula:textIF DATEPART('hour', NOW()) >= 15
AND DATEPART('hour', NOW()) < 17
THEN TRUE
ELSE FALSE
END→ Dragged to Filters shelf → Selected True
→ This makes the chart visible only during 3:00 PM – 4:59 PM IST (based on the current system time).

Chart Setup Summary:

Columns: Preference
Rows: AGG(Postings count) ← created calculated field with value 1 to count rows
Mark type: Automatic (Bar)
Sorted descending by Postings count
Title: “Task1-Intern, Bar Chart”

Result Note:
After applying all these conditions together, only a small number of postings remained (around 60 for Both, 50 for Female, 41 for Male). This shows how selective and strict the task requirements were.
