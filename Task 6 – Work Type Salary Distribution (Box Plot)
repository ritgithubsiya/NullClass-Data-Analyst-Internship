Task 6 – Work Type Salary Distribution (Box Plot):

Created a box-and-whisker plot showing how salary ranges are distributed for Intern jobs only.
The box shows the middle 50% of salaries, the line inside is the median, whiskers show the full range, and any dots outside are outliers.
Only very specific Intern postings are included after applying many strict filters.

Filters / Conditions Applied:

Work Type must be “Intern”
→ Dragged Work Type field to Filters shelf
→ Selected only “Intern”
→ This makes sure the box plot shows only internship jobs.

Latitude below 10
→ Dragged Latitude field to Filters shelf
→ Selected “Range of Values”
→ Set maximum < 10 (e.g., up to 9.99)
→ This keeps postings from locations near or below the equator.

Country name must not start with A, B, C, or D
→ Dragged Country field to Filters shelf
→ Went to General tab
→ Manually unselected countries starting with A, B, C, or D (or used wildcard exclude “A*”, “B*”, “C*”, “D*”)
→ This removes countries like Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, etc.

Job Title must have fewer than 10 characters and be a single word
→ Created calculated field named job title filter:
→ Formula:textLEN(TRIM([Job Title])) < 10 
AND 
CONTAINS([Job Title], ' ') = FALSE→ Dragged to Filters shelf → Selected True

Company Size < 50,000
→ Dragged Company Size field to Filters shelf
→ Selected “Range of Values”
→ Set maximum = 49,999
→ This includes only small and medium-sized companies.

Salary > $8,000
→ Created calculated field named minimum salary extracted:(reused from earlier tasks)
 Created second calculated field named salary > 8000:text[minimum salary extracted] > 8000→ Dragged salary > 8000 to Filters shelf → Selected True

Experience must be an even number
→ Created calculated field named even experience:
→ Formula:textINT([Experience]) % 2 = 0→ Dragged to Filters shelf → Selected True
→ This keeps only even years of experience (2, 4, 6, 8…).

Job Posting Date between 2021–2023
→ Dragged Job Posting Date field to Filters shelf
→ Selected “Range of Dates”
→ Set start: 01/01/2021 → end: 12/31/2023
→ This includes only postings from these three years.

Contact Person name must contain at least one “e”
→ Created calculated field named CP contains e:
→ Formula:textCONTAINS(LOWER([Contact Person]), 'e')→ Dragged to Filters shelf → Selected True
→ This keeps names that have at least one “e” (like Peter, Elena, Steve).

Chart must only be displayed between 3 PM and 5 PM IST
(reused from earlier tasks)

Chart Setup Summary:

Columns: Work Type (only Intern shows)
Rows: minimum salary extracted (measure showing lower end of salary range)
Mark type: Box-and-Whisker (selected from Show Me)
Title: “Task6-Box Plot”

Result Note
The box plot shows Intern salaries mostly between 55K and 65K (middle 50%), with median around 60K.
The whiskers go from about 50K to 70K.
Only a few postings matched all these strict rules — that’s why the box is small and clean.
