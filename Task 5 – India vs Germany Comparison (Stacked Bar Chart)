Task 5 – India vs Germany Comparison (Stacked Bar Chart):

Created a stacked bar chart comparing job postings between India and Germany.
The bar is stacked by Job Title (Data Scientist, Art Teacher, Aerospace Engineer).
India is colored orange, Germany is colored green.
Only female-preferred Full-Time jobs are shown after applying very strict filters.

Filters / Conditions Applied:

Qualification = B.Tech
→ Dragged Qualifications field to Filters shelf
→ Selected only “B.Tech”

Work Type = Full-Time
→ Dragged Work Type field to Filters shelf
→ Selected only “Full-Time”

Experience > 2 years
→ Step 1: Created calculated field named experience end
→ Formula (extracts the upper end of the experience range like “2 to 5 Years”):textINT(
    MID(
        [Experience],
        FIND([Experience], " to ") + 4,
        FIND([Experience], " Years") 
            - (FIND([Experience], " to ") + 4)
    )
)
→ Step 2: Created second calculated field named experience > 2
→ Formula:text[experience end] > 2→ Dragged experience > 2 to Filters shelf → Selected True

Job Title = Data Scientist, Art Teacher, or Aerospace Engineer
→ Dragged Job Title field to Filters shelf
→ Selected only “Data Scientist”, “Art Teacher”, and “Aerospace Engineer”

Salary must be above $10,000
→ Created calculated field named minimum salary extracted (reused from earlier tasks)
Created second calculated field named salary > 10000:text[minimum salary extracted] > 10000→ Dragged salary > 10000 to Filters shelf → Selected True

Job Portal = Indeed
→ Dragged Job Portal field to Filters shelf
→ Selected only “Indeed”

Preference = Female
→ Dragged Preference field to Filters shelf
→ Selected only “Female”

Only include postings before 08/01/2023
→ Dragged Job Posting Date field to Filters shelf
→ Selected “Range of Dates”
→ Set ending date as 08/01/2023 (maximum = 07/31/2023 or used relative date filter “before 08/01/2023”)

Location field must not be blank
→ Created calculated field named Location not blank:
→ Formula:textNOT ISNULL([Location]) AND TRIM([Location]) <> ""→ Dragged to Filters shelf → Selected True

Company Name must have more than 8 characters
→ Created calculated field named company > 8char:
→ Formula:textLEN(TRIM([Company Name])) > 8→ Dragged to Filters shelf → Selected True

Only India and Germany
→ Dragged Country field to Filters shelf
→ Selected only “India” and “Germany”

Chart must only be displayed between 3 PM and 5 PM IST
→ Created calculated field named show chart time(reused from earlier tasks)

Chart Setup Summary:

Columns: Country
Rows: AGG(Postings count) ← created calculated field with value 1 to count postings
Color: Job Title (stacked automatically)
Manual colors: India = Orange, Germany = Green
Mark type: Automatic (Bar)
Title: “Task5-Stacked Bar”

Result Note
After applying all these very strict filters together, only Germany has a few qualifying postings (around 2–3).
The bar is stacked (green for Art Teacher, light green for Aerospace Engineer).
India has zero postings that match every condition — this is not a mistake, it is because the rules were very selective (especially Female preference + B.Tech + specific job titles + salary + experience + date + company name length + location not blank).
The chart correctly shows only Germany as a result.
